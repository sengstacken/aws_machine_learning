    "To recap, we created a Domain dataset group, where you create preconfigured resources for different business domains and use cases, such as getting recommendations for similar videos (VIDEO_ON_DEMAND domain) or best selling items (ECOMMERCE domain). You choose your business domain, import your data, and create recommenders. You use recommenders in your application to get recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use a [Domain dataset group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/domain-dataset-groups.html) if you have a video on demand or e-commerce application and want Amazon Personalize to find the best configurations for your use cases. If you start with a Domain dataset group, you can also add custom resources such as solutions with solution versions trained with recipes for custom use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "A [Custom dataset group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/custom-dataset-groups.html), where you create configurable resources for custom use cases and batch recommendation workflows. You choose a recipe, train a solution version (model), and deploy the solution version with a campaign. You use a campaign in your application to get recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use a Custom dataset group if you don't have a video on demand or e-commerce application or want to configure and manage only custom resources, or want to get recommendations in a batch workflow. If you start with a Custom dataset group, you can't associate it with a domain later. Instead, create a new Domain dataset group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of the use case, the algorithms all share a base of learning on user-item-interaction data which is defined by 3 core attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **UserID** - The user who interacted\n",
    "1. **ItemID** - The item the user interacted with\n",
    "1. **Timestamp** - The time at which the interaction occurred\n",
    "\n",
    "We also support optional event types and event values defined by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Event Type** - Categorical label of an event (clicked, purchased, rated, listened, watched, etc).\n",
    "1. **Event Value** - A numeric value corresponding to the event type that occurred. This value can be used to filter interactions that are included in model training by specifying a minimum threshold. For example, suppose you have an event type of `Rated` and the value is the user rating on a scale of 0 to 5. Since Personalize models on positive interactions, you can use an event value threshold of, say, 3 to only include interactions with an event type of `Rated` that have an event value of 3 or higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "The event type and event value fields are additional data which can be used to filter the data sent for training the personalization model. In this particular exercise we dol not have an event value and will not be filtering the training data, i.e. we will use all available data for training (More information on how to use the eventValue with eventValueThreshold for Custom Domains in the [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/recording-events.html)). \n",
    "\n",
    "### In this notebook we will accomplish the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "Create Video on Demand Domain Recommenders for the following use cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [More like X](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/VIDEO_ON_DEMAND-use-cases.html#more-like-y-use-case): recommendations for movies that are similar to a movie that you specify. With this use case, Amazon Personalize automatically filters movies the user watched based on the userId that you specify and Watch events.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Top picks for you](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/VIDEO_ON_DEMAND-use-cases.html#top-picks-use-case): personalized content recommendations for a user that you specify. With this use case, Amazon Personalize automatically filters videos the user watched based on the userId that you specify and Watch events.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a custom solution and solution versions for the following use case:\n",
    "\n",
    "3. [Personalized-Ranking](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/working-with-predefined-recipes.html): will be used to rerank a list of movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Workflow](images/image2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "To run this notebook, you need to have run the previous notebook, `01_Data_Layer.ipynb`, where you created a dataset and imported interaction, item, and user metadata data into Amazon Personalize. At the end of that notebook, you saved some of the variable values, which you now need to load into this notebook."

The image below illustrates how Personalize splits the data. Given 10 users, with 10 interactions each (a circle represents an interaction), the interactions are ordered from oldest to newest based on the timestamp. Personalize uses all of the interaction data from 90% of the users (blue circles) to train the solution version, and the remaining 10% for evaluation. For each of the users in the remaining 10%, 90% of their interaction data (green circles) is used as input for the call to the trained model. The remaining 10% of their data (orange circle) is compared to the output produced by the model and used to calculate the evaluation metrics.\n",

    "\n",
    "You need to understand the following terms regarding evaluation in Personalize:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Relevant recommendation* refers to a recommendation that matches a value in the testing data for the particular user.\n",
    "* *Rank* refers to the position of a recommended item in the list of recommendations. Position 1 (the top of the list) is presumed to be the most relevant to the user.\n",
    "* *Query* refers to the internal equivalent of a GetRecommendations call.\n",
    "\n",
    "The metrics produced by Personalize are:\n",
    "* **coverage**: The proportion of unique recommended items from all queries out of the total number of unique items in the training data (includes both the Items and Interactions datasets).\n",
    "* **mean_reciprocal_rank_at_25**: The [mean of the reciprocal ranks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_reciprocal_rank) of the first relevant recommendation out of the top 25 recommendations over all queries. This metric is appropriate if you're interested in the single highest ranked recommendation.\n",
    "* **normalized_discounted_cumulative_gain_at_K**: Discounted gain assumes that recommendations lower on a list of recommendations are less relevant than higher recommendations. Therefore, each recommendation is discounted (given a lower weight) by a factor dependent on its position. To produce the [cumulative discounted gain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discounted_cumulative_gain) (DCG) at K, each relevant discounted recommendation in the top K recommendations is summed together. The normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG) is the DCG divided by the ideal DCG such that NDCG is between 0 - 1. (The ideal DCG is where the top K recommendations are sorted by relevance.) Amazon Personalize uses a weighting factor of 1/log(1 + position), where the top of the list is position 1. This metric rewards relevant items that appear near the top of the list, because the top of a list usually draws more attention.\n",
    "* **precision_at_K**: The number of relevant recommendations out of the top K recommendations divided by K. This metric rewards precise recommendation of the relevant items.\n",
