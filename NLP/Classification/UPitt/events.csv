83,31442230515344,The Urban Environmental Imaginary of Haitian Writers,"The Environmental Humanities welcome John Walsh (Pitt, French and Italian) for a colloquium to discuss his written work. There will be a prepared response by Noah Theriault (CMU, Anthropology). \n\nHaitian literature has long offered complex stories that fill voids left by reductive reports and images of Haiti propagated by all manner of media in the West. In this way, the literary imaginary is a witness to the diversity of Haitian lives. Yet, as Eric Prieto and Bertrand Westphal have argued, more than static representations of the world, literature and other aesthetic forms participate actively in the production of space. The literary text interrogates the ways in which public and private spaces are defined and manipulated by ideological forces, especially in the age of unbridled neoliberalism. Drawing on the insights of the so-called ""spatial turn"" in literary studies, as well as postcolonially-minded approaches to the environmental humanities, this paper examines the mapping of Haitian spaces, and in particular the urban environmental imaginary, in Yanick Lahens's latest novel, Douce d�routes (2018). My analysis takes as a point of departure the fictional reprise of a marketing campaign in Haiti, in early 2015, by Audi, the German automaker. What happens to the advertisement when it reappears in the pages of t"
